# Neuronix AI Project – Simple Greet Chatbot
## Project Overview

This project is a Simple Greet Chatbot Web App developed during my Neuronix AI Internship.
The goal of this project is to build a lightweight chatbot that greets users and responds to basic messages — helping beginners understand the structure of a chatbot, including frontend design, backend logic, and text-based message handling.

## Features

✅ Displays a greeting message automatically when the page loads
✅ Allows users to send messages through a text input box
✅ Shows both user and bot messages in a chat window
✅ Responds with simple text-based replies (e.g., “Hi there! How can I help you?”)
✅ Runs locally on your browser using localhost

## Tech Stack Used

Frontend: Chainlit
Backend: Python + OpenAI Agents SDK
Server: Localhost
